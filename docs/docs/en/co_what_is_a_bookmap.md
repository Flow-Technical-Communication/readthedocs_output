# What is a bookmap?

## Definition

A bookmap is a specialization of a [DITA map](co_what_is_a_dita_map.md) and is meant to be used when you intend to publish your documents in a book format. It contains structure and metadata, but no content. It is especially designed to create output in book-style formation and therefore includes the following major structures:

-   Title
-   Bookmeta \(owners, authors, publishing data,…\)
-   Front matter \(acknowledgments, definitions, abbreviations,…\)
-   Chapters and parts
-   Appendix topics
-   Back matter \(index, notices, lists,…\)
-   Relationship tables
