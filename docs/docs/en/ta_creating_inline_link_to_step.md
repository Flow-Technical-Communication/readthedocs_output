# To link an element

1.  Generate an ID for the element you want to link: right-click the `element` and choose **Generate IDs**.

2.  Insert an `xref (cross reference)` element into your text.

3.  In the Cross Reference \(xref\) dialog window, navigate to the topic that contains the element you want to reference.

4.  Select the correct element in the list.

    You can identify the correct element in the list by checking its Element ID or by using the preview tab at the bottom of the window.

    **Tip:** If you have generated many IDs for elements in that topic, choose your `element` in the drop-down menu Show elements of type to filter the list.

5.  Press **Insert and close**.

    **Tip:** If you have more references to add, you press **Insert** instead. The window remains open and you can insert another reference.
