    **Tip:** If you want to add a topic you are currently working in, choose **Reference to the currently edited file**.

    **Tip:** If you want to add a new topic, choose **New...**.

2.  In the Insert Topic Reference dialog window, navigate to the reference you want to insert.

    **Note:** If you chose **Reference to the currently edited file** option, your current file will already be selected.

3.  Do one of the following:

    -   If you have more than one topic to add, choose **Insert** and repeat from step [2](#step_fmb_nrm_sfb) until you have added all the desired topics. Then click **Close** to return to your DITA map.
    -   Choose **Insert and close** if this is the only topic you wish to add.
4.  Save the DITA map.

    **Tip:** You can also drag and drop a topic file to your DITA map. You can drag files from your file system explorer, the Project view or the Open/Find Resources view.
