# To group glossary terms on a single output page

Dedicating an entire page to a term in output may look odd. Therefore, you can group them on one output page:

1.  Open the glossary ditamap.

2.  Select the first `topicref`.

3.  Enter the value "to-content" for the `@chunk` attribute.

    **Note:** Make sure the glossentry topics are entered as a `topicref` and not as a `glossref`.
