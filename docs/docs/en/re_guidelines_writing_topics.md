# Guidelines for chunking content

The first challenge in topic-based authoring is chunking your content into discrete topics. It's hard to determine the ideal length of a topic: it should be short enough to answer a single question but still include enough information to stand on its own. In addition to that, consider Miller's law when chunking your content.

## Answer a single question

Each topic should answer a single question. If you cannot grasp the content of a particular topic with a single question, you should split it into two or more smaller topics.

Which kind of question a particular topic answers, helps you to determine the information type of that topic:

|Question|Information type|
|--------|----------------|
|How do I insert batteries in my camera?|Task topic|
|What is white balance?|Concept topic|
|What do these battery icons mean?|Reference topic|

## Include enough information

Although a topic can only answer a single question, it should still contain enough information to make sense on its own. Which info the topic has to contain, depends on the information type:

|Information type|Contains at least the following info|
|----------------|------------------------------------|
|Task topic|To begin and complete a particular task|
|Concept topic|To grasp a particular concept|
|Reference topic|To look up and understand particular information|

**Note:** Topics often include related content. A particular task topic can, for example, use concepts that are described in separate concept topics. As a result, it is impossible to make each topic completely autonomous. You can solve that problem by adding related links to your topic: the body part of your topic then remains discrete, while you still guide the user to the related information.

## Miller's law \(7 ± 2\)

According to Miller's law, an average person can only hold 7 ± 2 objects in his working memory. You should mind that law when chunking content into topics. For example, if you are writing a task topic and you notice that it contains over ten steps, try to reduce the number of steps. You can do this with one or both of the following methods:

-   Group short steps: the steps "Choose **File**", "Choose **New**", and "Choose **Topic"**, for example, can be grouped into "Choose **File** \> **New** \> **Topic**."
-   Split your task into two or more subtasks: you can then include an overview topic that describes the entire process and which refers to the different steps \(subtasks\) of that process.

The same goes for other lists. For example, if you have a list of twenty safety instructions, group the related instructions in separate sections. You can then also include a specific title for each group of safety instructions, to better guide the users.
