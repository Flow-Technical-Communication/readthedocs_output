# Inline links

Inline links are links that you add within the text of your topic, rather than directly to the DITA map structure or in the relationship table. They are cross-references which are displayed by the `xref` element. The `xref` element can be used to:

-   `xref (cross references)`: insert a reference to content of a DITA document
-   `xref (webpages)`: insert a reference to a web page

Inline links can be difficult to maintain and too many of them can distract or confuse users. Make sure to only use links when it is relevant to do so, otherwise the links:

-   Can be disruptive: they break the flow of reading because they direct users to other topics before they have finished reading the information in the current topic.
-   Create dependencies between topics that are difficult to maintain and restrict the extent to which you can re-use the topics.
-   Can complicate navigation: using too many links can be a sign that you haven't organized your structure well. It might be necessary to reevaluate or even rewrite your topic and/or structure.
-   Weigh content: links should be used to direct users to something important and relevant. The more you use links, the more they lose their value.
