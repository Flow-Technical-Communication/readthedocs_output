# To link another topic

1.  \(Optional\) Generate an ID for the topic you want to link: right-click the `topicref` and choose **Generate IDs**.

2.  Insert an `xref (cross reference)` element into your text.

3.  In the Cross Reference \(xref\) dialog window, navigate to the desired topic.

4.  Select the topic in the list.

    **Tip:** If you have generated many IDs for elements in that topic, choose `topicref` in the drop-down menu Show elements of type to filter the list.

5.  Click **Insert and close**.

    **Tip:** If you have more references to add, press **Insert** instead. The window remains open and you can insert another reference.

6.  \(Optional\) Replace the name of the topic with different text by positioning your cursor just before the final `xref` tag and typing in a new name.

    **Note:** This does not change the original topic title.
