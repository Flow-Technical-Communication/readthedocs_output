# What are tooltips?

If your documentation contains a lot of technical terms or acronyms, you can support your reader with a glossary. Glossaries are usually limited to static lists, added as a chapter at the end of a manual.

However, Oxygenâ€™s WebHelp outputs offer a solution whereby users are no longer forced to leave the page they are reading: glossaries through tooltips. Tooltips are one-term glossary pop-ups that appear on screen if you hover your mouse over the term or acronym. If you click the term, the glossary item opens as a separate topic. To add them, follow the next steps:

-   [Create a glossary](ta_creating_a_glossary.md)
-   [Reference the glossary term](ta_reference_the_glossary_term_in_a_topic.md)
