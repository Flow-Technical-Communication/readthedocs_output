# Bookmap elements

The `bookmap` element is a specialized element used to configure a map as a traditional book. Therefore, they consist of references to topics organized as book content and specific book elements: `booktitle`, `frontmatter`, `chapter` and `appendix`.

A bookmap contains a `booktitle`, which contains the title information for a book:

-   The library title \(`booklibrary`\): information about series, library of collection of documents to which the book belongs
-   The main title \(`mainbooktitle`\)
-   The subtitle or alternative title \(`booktitlealt`\)

To structure the bookmap, the `chapter` and `part` elements are used:

-   `chapter`: references a topic or map as a chapter within a book
-   `part`: references part topics or maps that reference part topics for the book and divides a document's chapters into logical groupings
