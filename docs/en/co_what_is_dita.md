# What is DITA?

## Definition

DITA is an open standard to structure documentation and is therefore often used in technical writing.

It stands for Darwin Information Typing Architecture.

-   **Darwin**

    A set of information models that can evolve and be specialized to account for the client's particular authoring and publishing needs.

-   **Information Typing**

    Content is organized in chunks of information called "topics" and topics are categorized by the type of information they contain:

    -   Task
    -   Concept
    -   Reference
    -   Other types of information
-   **Architecture**

    A set of standardized, open-source, well-documented information models for various types of content


## History

DITA was originally developed by IBM but since 2005 it is defined and maintained by OASIS, a non-profit consortium comprised of members from the technology industry, users and influencers.

## Features

-   [Re-use](co_why_reuse_content.md)
    -   [Single sourcing](co_single_sourcing.md) \(content â†” context\)
    -   [Multi-channel publishing](co_multichannel_publishing.md) \(write content once, publish to multiple outputs\)
-   Collaboration with other authors
-   [Minimalism](co_minimalism.md)
-   [Structured authoring](co_structured_authoring.md)
-   Intelligent content
-   [Conditional content](co_what_is_conditional_processing.md)

DITA and structured authoring are closely related. The first three DITA features are also structured authoring features.
