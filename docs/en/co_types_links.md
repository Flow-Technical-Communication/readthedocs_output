# Different types of links

In DITA you can link your information together in many different ways. The system allows you to link:

-   Within your topic text \([Inline links](co_what_are_inline_links.md)\)
-   At the end of your individual topics \([Related links](co_what_are_related_links.md)\)
-   Outside of your topic by using a separate table \([Relationship tables](co_including_reltable.md)\) in a DITA map
-   Outside of your topic by using the DITA map structure \([Hierarchical links](co_what_are_hierarchical_links.md)\)

Each type of linking has its advantages and disadvantages so it is good to know which type to use when.
