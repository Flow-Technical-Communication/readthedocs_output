# What is an information type?

An information type is a category in which all information can be placed, based on the purpose or function of that information for the reader. Information typing is the practice of organizing or classifying your information according to its type.



The three core information types in DITA are the following:

|Information type|Description|
|----------------|-----------|
|**Task**|Task topics include the steps of a particular task or procedure. They answer the question “How to…?”.|
|**Concept**|Concept topics include background information that users must know \(For example, definitions or examples\) before executing a particular task or procedure. They answer the question “What is…?” or "What does a certain term mean?".|
|**Reference**|Reference topics provide quick access to reference information that is relevant to the subject at hand. Reference information is often presented as a list or a table \(For example, an overview of error codes or a bibliography\). Reference topics contain "facts without explanation".|

Generic topics \(**topic**\) and **troubleshooting** topics should only be used for specific purposes:

|Information type|Description|
|----------------|-----------|
|**Topic**|Generic topics are designed as a starting point for specialization. We use them, however, to create title-only topics when composing a DITA map.|
|**Troubleshooting**|Troubleshooting topics are designed to explain specific conditions. They contain a cause and remedy part for users to understand and solve their problems.|

Technical writers split up texts depending on the kind of information they want to present to the reader. By using information types to filter and structure the information, the reader will no longer have to spend energy on this when reading the text.

The components in an information type and their structure and hierarchy are defined in the information model the writer uses.
