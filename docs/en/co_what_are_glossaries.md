# What are glossaries?

A glossary is used to define terminology. It has the following advantages:

-   Ensures that a team of writers uses the same term for the same concept
-   Provides the reader with definitions of unfamiliar terms

In your output, you can find the glossary:

-   At the front or back of the book when printed
-   Via a link on the document toolbar in an online document
-   Via hyperlinked terms in the content of an online document

A glossary can contain:

-   A term and its definition \(`glosterm` and `glosdef`\): see [General glossary elements](co_including_glossary.md)
-   Extra term information, such as symbols, the part of speech and scope notes: see [Extra term information](co_additional_term_information.md)
-   Variants of the term \(contained within the `glossAlt` element\): see [Variants of a term](co_variant_of_term.md)
