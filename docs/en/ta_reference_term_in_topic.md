# To reference a glossary term in a topic

1.  Place your cursor where you want to insert the glossary term.

2.  Search the key of the glossary term you want to insert in the **Keys** tab of the **DITA Reusable Components** window.

    **Tip:** If there is no **DITA Reusable Components** window visible, select **Window** \> **Show View** \> **DITA Reusable Components**.

3.  Right-click the key and select **Insert as Keyref** \> **keyword**.

    **Note:** You can also insert a glossary term as **abbreviated-form**, provided that you added a `glossSurfaceForm` and `glossAcronym` \(see [Extra term information](co_additional_term_information.md)\).
