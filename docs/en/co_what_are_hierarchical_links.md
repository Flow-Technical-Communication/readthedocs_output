# Hierarchical links

You create hierarchical links by nesting topics in your DITA map and creating parent, child and sibling topics. Doing so gives structure to your topics and helps users understand how you have organized your information. This hierarchy is used to create the sequence of topics in the output and/or the table of contents. It also influences automatically-generated navigation links and generated summary content in parent topics in some output formats.
