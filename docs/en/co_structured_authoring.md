# Structured authoring

## Definition

Structured authoring is a way of writing in which one or more authors use:

-   A common, limited set of components \(“information building blocks”\) set by an information model.
-   Standards, rules and guidelines to structure the text.

## Result

Structured authoring separates the content from the layout. It structures content through information models and layout through templates and style sheets. These output any content in different layout styles.

## Purpose

-   Maximize consistency

    -   Content
    -   Structure
-   [Re-use](co_why_reuse_content.md)

    -   [Single sourcing](co_single_sourcing.md) \(content ↔ context\)
    -   [Multi-channel publishing](co_multichannel_publishing.md) \(write content once, publish to multiple outputs\)
-   Collaboration with other authors

## Use

You can apply structured authoring to all kinds of texts. It is not limited to the type of software application you use. You can therefore use structured authoring in:

-   Word processing programs such as Microsoft Word
-   Desktop publishing software such as Adobe InDesign
-   Document processors such as Adobe FrameMaker
-   Help authoring tools such as MadCap Flare
-   XML programs such as Oxygen XML Author or JustSystems XMetaL
-   Wikis such as Confluence or MediaWiki
