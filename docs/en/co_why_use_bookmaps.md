# Why use bookmaps?

A bookmap is best suited for when you specifically want to create output in the traditional form of a book. Its template allows you to organize your content in a book format by adding, among others, chapters, parts and appendixes.

**Note:** Bookmaps are not suited for output formats other than traditional book formats. If you are planning different types of output, you should consider using a regular DITA map and including book metadata by using the elements and attributes in the `topicmeta` element.

You use DITA to publish a research paper, so you write your information in a bookmap and add the necessary chapters. You can now make use of, for instance, the frontmatter to add a cover and the backmatter for glossaries.
