# MkDocs Static site generator

MkDocs is a static site generator to build documentation based on files written in Markdown and configured by a YAML file. You can host these static sites on several hosting platforms. You can also test it before publication on a localhost. Static site integrate well with versioning tools like  and Gitlab.

Working in DITA does not mean you cannot work with a static site generator. On the one hand, you write the documentation in DITA and benefit from the advantages of the documentation standard and generate Markdown files as output format. On the other hand, you can write your blog articles directly in Markdown and publish it on the fly in your static site project.

Before you can start publishing your DITA files to a Mdocs site, you have to:

-   Install the latest version of Python
-   Create a MkDocs project
-   Install the correct ReadTheDocs dita-ot plug-in.
